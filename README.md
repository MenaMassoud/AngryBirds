# AngryBirds
My version of angry bird game developed using unity and C#

The game include:

1- Import arts (Background, birds, boxes, monsters).
2- Code to control the bird using the mouse(Dragging the bird, Launching and adding force).
3- Add physics (Rigidbody2d, Box collider 2D, Polygon Collider 2D, Line renderer(indicator for the bird direction in release)...etc).
4- Camera controller (cinemachine)
5- Adding partices(spread clouds when monsters are destroyed).
6- Prefab.
7- Create multiple levels.

The game was developed using the help of the following resources:
1- Jason Weimann youtube channel video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR0e-1UBEOU)
2- Tutorial point website (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unity/index.htm)
